ASA
HISTORY
Once ASA began its journey in 1940, the
company’s primary goal soon became the
training of post-war military pilots returning
from active duty to work in the early civilian
airlines. Plotters, regulations and training
manuals were the first products. In 1960,
the company broadened its production and
development efforts with additional pilot
supplies and books added to the ground
school training line.
In 1969, the company became Northwest
School of Aviation. The goal was to franchise
the popular Merrell Ground School under the
name “Aviation Seminars of America,” or ASA.
In November, 1976, “Aviation Supplies and
Academics” replaced Aviation Seminars of
America as the name to go with the ASA
acronym, and the company again broadened
its product line to add cassette courses, new
books and training materials. The company was incorporated in 1977 and publishing and manufacturing became
the principal company mission.
In 1984, the sale of the ground school (Aviation Training and Research, Inc.) and the retail store (The Aviator’s
Store) allowed all efforts to be directed towards becoming
a major supplier of pilot supplies and educational material in the United States. In 1985, ASA moved to larger
quarters in Georgetown, and again to its present Coal
Creek location in 1990 to provide more warehouse and
office space.
The ASA FAR/AIM has been in publication since 1945, and the ASA Test Preps
have been in production for more than
60 years. Since those early days, many
products have been added to the line
including textbooks, software, apps, online courses, videos, flight instructor tools,
aviation maintenance technician materials, logbooks, flight computers (manual
E6B and the electronic CX-3), aviation
plotters, kneeboards, flight bags, remote
pilot and drone materials, and more. Additional pilot supply items and book titles
are being added, as our team of Authors
and Subject Matter Experts has continued to grow.
Our distribution network has grown
as well, with domestic and international
distributors promoting and representing
the full ASA product line around the globe. ASA products
are used worldwide in all training environments: ICAO,
CAA, FAA Part 61/141/147, manufacturers training, colleges, universities, STEM/magnet programs, ab initio training, general aviation airports, and aviators everywhere
for self-study.
Aviation Supplies and Academics, Inc. does business as “ASA.” ASA is the leading publisher of
aviation books and the largest producer of
pilot supplies in the USA today, providing
trusted materials for more 80 years.

Finding Carla
by Ross Nixon
In March 1967, a Cessna 195
crashed in the mountains
of northern California. A
family of three survived
for almost two months but
weather, the ruggedness of
the terrain, and deviation
from their intended
course made finding
them by sight impossible.
The tragedy spurred
political action towards
mandatory Emergency
Locator Transmitters
(ELTs) now carried aboard
all U.S. civil aircraft.
